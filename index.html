She lives with her mother, 11-year-old sister, and maternal grandfather.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chief Complaint</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">According to Heather’s mother, over the past few months, Heather has been very irritable and nervous. She has not been sleeping well, and teachers have been complaining about Heather’s excessive activity and silliness at school.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History of Present Illness</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Heather’s mother described Heather as a generally happy child, who gets along well with her relatives. She is well liked at school and has several friends in the neighborhood. How­ ever, for the past 3–4 months, according to the mother, Heather’s mood has been mostly “up.” Heather frequently laughs and giggles for no apparent reason. At school, she seems too energetic and she giggles so much that she is unable to recite the morning prayer and Pledge of Allegiance. Heather’s mother said that teachers have complained about Heather’s exces­ sive silliness and describe times when she talks so fast that she is difficult to understand. Her mother reported that Heather has so much energy that she sometimes takes 2–3 hours to fall asleep, and when she awakens at 6 A.M., she continues to be very active and does not appear to be tired despite sleeping 2–3 hours less than usual. Her mother also reported that at times Heather talks so fast and jumps from one subject to another so quickly that it is</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">63 </p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">hard to follow what Heather is saying. Heather tells her mother that her “thoughts are going around and around in my head.” She has been learning Bible verses at school and some­ times walks around the house chanting Bible verses and is unable to stop. Heather is fo­ cused on becoming a singer, actress, or model and keeps asking her mother to find out how she can get on the television program <i>The Voice. </i>Her mother described Heather as being quite insistent about appearing on television and said that Heather really believes she will be a “star.” She is slightly hypersexual and crawls onto adults’ laps in a flirtatious manner and has begun kissing her mother on the mouth, which is very unusual for Heather. She has been more irritable and argumentative over the past few months. Heather’s frustration tol­ erance is low; at times she “explodes” when she cannot have what she wants, and some­ times she is aggressive with her sister. Heather and her mother both denied that Heather has suicidal and homicidal ideations. Her mother reported that the above-noted symptoms may last from 3 to 7 days a week, with minimal in-between euthymic periods. Heather’s mother is unaware of any event that may have precipitated this change in Heather’s mood and behavior.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Both Heather and her mother denied current depressive symptoms. However, Heather</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">has experienced two episodes of major depression in the past (see “Past Psychiatric His­ tory,” below).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Heather can also be anxious. Over the past 7–8 months, she has experienced 10 panic at­ tacks. She endorsed all associated symptoms, including palpitations, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, choking, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, chills and hot flushes, numb­ ness/tingling, derealization/depersonalization, fear of losing control, and fear of dying. Each attack lasts about 20 minutes. Some of the panic attacks have been unexpected. Both Heather and her mother denied that these symptoms are impairing or that Heather has changed her behavior in response to the attacks.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Heather stated that “ever since I can remember,” she has not liked to be separated from her mother. When her mother is away from home, Heather often worries that her mother will “have an accident, not come back, or run away.” Heather also worries every day that she herself will be killed or kidnapped. She does not have a tantrum or cry when her mother leaves the house, but she always begs her mother to stay home. She admitted that during the last school year, she pretended to be sick on several occasions to stay home. Heather of­ ten follows her mother from room to room. On most nights, Heather cannot sleep alone and sleeps with her mother. Heather also reported having nightmares, almost every night, involving a separation theme.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Her mother indicated that Heather worries more than other children her age and that Heather has multiple worries about things happening at home and school most days of the week. The worries are about future and past events. Heather stated that she cannot control her worries, and her mother reported that Heather often experiences muscle tension and stomachaches. Her mother stated that Heather is very self-conscious, worries a lot about competence, and needs much reassurance. Heather has recently been especially worried about her school performance and has been extremely anxious when taking tests, saying that her mind “goes blank” during the test.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Past Psychiatric History</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When Heather was 5 years old, she was depressed for 8 months. When she was 8 years old, she became depressed again. She told her mother that she felt “like she wanted to cut her­ self.” She had taken the scissors and thought about cutting her throat. She endorsed feeling sad most of the day, every day; not being interested in her usual activities; having difficulty falling asleep and feeling tired during the day; loss of appetite; inability to concentrate; and decreased self-esteem. Heather denied ever having attempted suicide. The first episode of depression subsided without treatment. For the second episode, Heather was treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for 7 months. Heather was also treated with sertraline 50 mg/day for 4–6 weeks, but her mother discontinued this medication, stating that it made Heather “worse.” While taking sertraline, Heather began to experience panic attacks, which persisted after the medication was discontinued.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Heather’s mother also reported that prior to the onset of depressive symptoms, Heather exhibited difficulty paying attention to tasks, being easily distracted, being forgetful, frequently losing her belongings, having difficulty following through with instructions, and fidgeting. However, Heather never was hyperactive or impulsive. Her mother reported that the inatten­ tion tends to be persistent but worsens when Heather’s mood becomes silly or “up.”</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Heather has no history of other psychiatric disorders, including psychotic disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, autistic spectrum disorders, psychosis, and substance use disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Medical History</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Heather has no history of medical problems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Developmental History</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Heather’s mother reports having had a normal pregnancy and delivery, and Heather had normal achievement of developmental milestones.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Social History</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Heather lives with her biological mother, 11-year-old sister, and 81-year-old grandfather. Her biological mother has full custody, and her biological father has limited involvement with Heather. He has weekly supervised visits with Heather, although recently Heather has not wished to see her father. Her mother described Heather’s father as alcoholic and added that he has been verbally abusive to Heather in the past.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Heather is enrolled in the third grade at a local private school. Her mother reported that Heather is a good student, although recently her grades have been affected by her manic symptoms. According to her mother, although Heather is usually “popular” with peers and has no problems with making friends, she started a new school this year and has not yet established any close friendships. Heather and her mother report no history of physical or sexual abuse.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Family History</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Heather’s mother has been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, and alcohol use disorder. She was treated for postpartum depression after Heather’s birth and has had multiple psychiatric hos­ pitalizations.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Heather’s father has a history of major depressive disorder, as well as alcohol and co­ caine use disorders.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Heather’s 11-year-old sister has been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mental Status Examination</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Heather is a 9-year-old girl who appeared her stated age. She was dressed provocatively, wearing a sheer animal print blouse, which exposed part of her midriff, and a bright scarf. Heather was friendly, outgoing, and cooperative with the interview. She was distract­</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ible but seemed to make an effort to pay attention to questions. She was very talkative and at times drifted to an unrelated topic, but she responded well to redirection. Heather was restless and fidgeted in her seat and had more difficulty staying in her seat as the interview progressed. She described her mood as “good” and “happy,” and her affect was congruent. Her speech was rapid at times but not pressured. Heather denied hallucinations and sui­ cidal or homicidal ideation. Heather was aware that she has been getting into trouble at school because she is “too silly” and has “too much energy inside” but stated that she can­ not control this behavior.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="1" alt="image" src="biopolar/Image_002.png"/></span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Psychotherapeutic Perspective</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Mary A. Fristad, Ph.D.,  ABPP</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic Formulation</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The assessment of bipolar disorder should include a detailed, longitudinal summation of the onset, offset, and duration of manic and depressive symptoms in relation to stressful life events, a medical history (including psychotropic and other medication utilization), a de­ velopmental history, assessment of school adjustment, and a three-generational family his­</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">tory; information regarding symptoms should be elicited from both the child and the parent (Danner et al. 2009). Heather’s case meets these criteria. Self-report inventories, such as the Parent General Behavior Inventory—10 Item Mania Scale (Youngstrom et al. 2008), are effective screening devices, and rating scales are useful for documenting symp­ tom severity, but neither can be used to make a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (Danner et al. 2009). However, mood rating scales and self-report inventories—clinician-rated forms com­ pleted during office visits and mood charts that Heather and/or her mother complete at home—are useful for monitoring treatment response and to track changes in diagnosis.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Heather’s presentation illustrates several features common to childhood-onset bipolar spectrum disorders (bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, other specified bipolar and related disorder). First, she has multiple symptoms of anxiety, including panic, separation, and generalized anxiety disorders. Second, her symptoms manifested at an early age, with her first depressive episode notable by age 5. Third, when treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for a depressive episode, Heather deteriorated. Fourth, Heather appears to have preexisting attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), inattentive type, the symptoms of which appear worse when Heather is manic. Clear exacerbation of the “overlap” symptoms of distractibility and increased goal-directed activity is needed to count these as symptoms of both ADHD and bipolar disorder. Fifth, Heather has a signif­ icant family history. Her father has a history of major depressive disorder, and her mother and sister have been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Heather has had two past episodes of depression. Currently, she is exhibiting manic symptoms, including both euphoric and irritable mood, grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness, flight of ideas, distractibility, psychomotor agitation, and hypersexuality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DSM-5 Diagnosis</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">❚ <span class="s6">F31.12 Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode manic, moderate</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">❚ <span class="s6">F90.0 Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive presentation</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">❚ <span class="s6">F93.0 Separation anxiety disorder</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">❚ <span class="s6">F41.1 Generalized anxiety disorder</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;">❚ <span class="s6">Z62.820 Parent-child relational problem (poor relationship with father, who has been verbally abusive in the past and is diagnosed with alcohol and cocaine use disorders)</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;">❚ <span class="s6">Z65.8 Other problem related to psychosocial circumstances (mother who has had multiple psychiatric hospitalizations and is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; sister who is also diagnosed with bipolar I disorder)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Treatment Recommendations</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First, Heather should receive a medication evaluation (as discussed by Kowatch, in his com­ mentary later in this chapter). Second, Heather and her family should begin family psy­ choeducation plus skill building (Fristad and MacPherson 2014). Treatment of pediatric bipolar and related disorders should include family involvement; psychoeducation about etiology, symptoms, course, medications, risk and protective factors, and effective treat­ ment; skill building, especially communication, problem-solving, and emotion regulation skills; and relapse prevention (Fristad and MacPherson 2014). Three evidence-based treat­ ments have been tested for children Heather’s age: individual family psychoeducational psychotherapy (PEP; Fristad 2006), multi-family PEP (Fristad et al. 2009), and the RAIN- BOW program (West et al. 2014). Heather and her mother might first participate in a multi-family group and then follow up in individual family therapy, or they might begin immediately with the latter, depending on what services are available in their community. Group and individual family interventions have different pragmatic and clinical advan­ tages and disadvantages (Fristad 2006). Heather and her family should work with a thera­ pist familiar with childhood-onset bipolar disorder to avoid the many misattributions about symptoms that can occur when a therapist does not have such knowledge (Mackinaw- Koons and Fristad 2004). Heather has had suicidal ideation previously; this should be care­ fully monitored throughout treatment.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The stability of Heather’s mother and sister needs to be considered. Because multiple</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">family members with bipolar disorder can be stressors for one another (family mood chart­ ing can illustrate this), all family members in the home should receive comprehensive care. Family sessions can address how members can cope best with their own symptoms and the stressors inherent in the home. As a part of this approach, Heather and her family should be assisted in establishing family routines around meals and sleep.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Heather is currently estranged from her father, who may not be stable currently. In­ viting him to a family therapy session might provide an opportunity to assist him in resum­ ing active treatment for his substance use disorder and depression.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Heather’s psychotherapy should also address her anxiety symptoms. Comorbid anxiety disorders are a negative predictor of outcome (DelBello et al. 2007), so minimizing their impact will be critical to her overall success. CBT is recommended to treat both separation and generalized anxiety disorders. If CBT successfully reduces Heather’s anxiety, medica­ tions (SSRIs) to target anxiety can be avoided, which is desirable because SSRIs can trigger manic symptoms. Also, her ADHD, inattentive type, should be targeted. Medication man­ agement of her inattentive symptoms may be required after her mood is stabilized. Heather and her family will also need to understand how these symptoms typically manifest and how they can be managed at home.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">As part of Heather’s psychosocial intervention, school-based functioning should be monitored. Heather historically has been a good student and has done well with academ­ ics, behavior, and social interactions. However, these areas of functioning have been affected by her current illness. Additionally, her ADHD, inattentive type, quite likely has</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.thebalancedmind.org/learn/education-issues" class="a" target="_blank">negative impacts on her school performance. Thus, communication between the mental health team, family, and school professionals may be helpful to generate an intervention strategy for Heather at school. In particular, I recommend providing school staff with educa­ tional material (for resources, see </a>www.thebalancedmind.org/learn/education-issues) and deciding on a prearranged “cool-off” setting, the use of which either Heather’s teacher or Heather can initiate.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.thebalancedmind.org/connect/support-groups" class="a" target="_blank">Finally, Heather’s mother may benefit from joining an online support group (see </a>www.thebalancedmind.org/connect/support-groups). Heather, her sister, and her mother may all benefit from learning more about their disorders (see “Resources” in Fristad et al. 2011).</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">If these interventions are not successful in ameliorating Heather’s symptoms, medica­ tion readjustment should be considered. Additionally, Heather and her mother should work with their therapist to update treatment goals (see Fristad et al. 2011, pp. 82–83, 97) and continue to implement and test the efficacy of interventions they devise collaboratively in therapy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="1" alt="image" src="biopolar/Image_003.png"/></span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Psychopharmacologic Perspective</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Robert A.

Because DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) does not include separate criteria for children and adolescents with a manic episode, the adult criteria must be used.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">DSM-5 Diagnosis</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The criteria for manic episode in DSM-5 include 1) evidence of a mood disturbance, 2) three or more manic symptoms, 3) a functional impairment caused by the mood symptoms, and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">4) exclusion criteria that the manic symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">DSM-5 manic episode requires “persistently increased goal-directed activity or en­ ergy” (Criterion A). Heather’s mother reported that although her daughter “has so much energy that she sometimes takes 2–3 hours to fall asleep,” the shortened sleep time did not stop her from being very active or make her appear to be tired.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Heather’s mother reported that Heather had a change of mood for several months, which included frequent laughter and giggling for no apparent reason; that she has been more irritable and argumentative; and that her frustration tolerance was low, “exploding” when she could not have what she wanted. Therefore, DSM-5 criterion for a “distinct pe­ riod” of a mood disturbance of sufficient duration is met.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The following are the DSM-5 Criterion B symptoms for mania and what the patient’s mother reports:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity: Heather is focused on becoming a singer, actress, or model. Her mother says that Heather really believes she will be a “star.”</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">Decreased need for sleep: Heather takes 2–3 more hours to fall asleep but awakens ac­ tive and energetic.</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking at times: Heather “talks so fast and jumps from one subject to another so quickly that it is hard to follow what Heather is saying.”</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing: Heather described her thoughts as “going around and around in my head.”</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">Distractibility: During the mental status examination, it was noted that Heather was dis­ tractible but seemed to make an effort to pay attention to questions.</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">Increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation: Heather recently began crawling onto adults’ laps in a flirtatious manner and has begun kissing her mother on the mouth.</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences: These symptoms are difficult for a 9-year-old child to carry out and are not reported in this case.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Heather’s illness is causing “marked impairment” in several domains. At school, she seems too energetic, and her silliness interferes with her reciting the morning prayer and Pledge of Allegiance. She talks so fast that she is difficult to understand, and her grades have been affected. Since starting her new school, she has not established close friendships. If an adult demonstrated these same symptoms in the workplace, he or she would be sent home or to the emergency room. Heather’s symptoms are noticed at home and school and affect her functioning. It is not clear if her manic symptoms are why she has no friends at school, but this is a possibility.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">DSM-5 also requires that the episode not be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., drug of abuse, medication, other treatment) or to another medical con­</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">dition. Heather is not taking medication and has no medical disorders, and there is no his­ tory of substance abuse.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The patient has had several prior episodes of major depression, and there is a strong family history of bipolar disorder. The best predictors of childhood pediatric bipolar dis­ order are early onset of depressive episodes (Luby and Belden 2008) and a family history of bipolar disorder (Birmaher et al. 2010).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Comorbid Disorders</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Children and adolescents with bipolar disorder commonly present with co-occurring psy­ chiatric disorders, including ADHD and anxiety disorders (Pavuluri et al. 2005; Sala et al. 2012). Heather has symptoms of panic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and general­ ized anxiety disorder. She also has symptoms of ADHD—difficulty paying attention to tasks, being easily distracted, being forgetful, frequently losing her belongings, having dif­ ficulty following through with instructions, and fidgeting.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">DSM-5 does allow for the addition of specifiers to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. One of these is “with anxious distress.” These specifiers, however, were included for increased specificity and do not replace comorbid disorders that are important to recognize and treat. It is possible to diagnose Heather with bipolar disorder with the specifier “with anxious dis­ tress” and also include any other DSM-5 disorders.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DSM-5 Diagnosis</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">❚ <span class="s6">F31.12 Bipolar disorder, current episode manic, moderate severity, with anxious distress</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">❚ <span class="s6">F93.0 Separation anxiety disorder</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">❚ <span class="s6">F41.1 Generalized anxiety disorder (provisional)</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">❚ <span class="s6">F90.0 Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive presentation (provisional)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Treatment Recommendations</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The first thing to consider before starting medication for a manic episode in a young pa­ tient is whether the patient is at the point at which symptoms and dysfunction require phar­ macotherapy. Heather is symptomatic at home and school. The overall strategy when treating children and adolescents with bipolar disorder is to stabilize mood first and then treat other comorbid disorders, such as ADHD or anxiety disorders, as necessary after mood is stabilized. If a child or adolescent presents with a “classic” euphoric mania without psy­ chotic symptoms, as Heather does, then a trial of lithium may be helpful. Often, however, it is difficult to maintain a child on lithium for extended periods of time because of the as­ sociated weight gain, exacerbation of acne, and hypothyroidism (Kowatch et al. 2011). The</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">second-generation antipsychotics, although efficacious, may also cause significant side ef­ fects that must be recognized and managed effectively. These side effects include extrapy­ ramidal effects, tardive dyskinesia, obesity, hyperlipidemia, increased prolactin levels, and cardiac QTc changes. Some evidence indicates that children and adolescents may be more susceptible to these side effects than adults. A review of these adverse effects is beyond the scope of this section, but Correll and colleagues have published several reviews on this topic (Correll 2011; Correll et al. 2009).</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">For children with bipolar disorder and co-occurring ADHD, mood stabilization with a traditional mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic is a necessary prerequisite prior to initiating stimulant medications (Biederman et al. 1999). A typical dose of such stimulants for a child with bipolar disorder and ADHD would be methylphenidate 18–36 mg/day or extended-release dextroamphetamine and amphetamine mixed salts 5–10 mg/day. Treat­ ment for Heather’s anxiety symptoms is best approached with CBT because SSRIs tend to cause increased mood cycling over time (Goldsmith et al. 2011).</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">If the provisional diagnosis of ADHD is confirmed, treatment for the ADHD is rec­ ommended after Heather’s mood is stabilized.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="1" alt="image" src="biopolar/Image_004.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">References</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edi­ tion.
